## OneVote - A Digital Voting System using Blockchain To ensure Secure Voting from anywhere
**OneVote** is a digital voting system built on blockchain technology, designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections that can be accessed from anywhere.
By leveraging the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain, OneVote eliminates common vulnerabilities in traditional voting methods, such as vote manipulation, fraud, and lack of transparency. 
Each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, ensuring it cannot be altered or deleted once cast. 
This system empowers voters to participate in elections remotely with confidence, maintaining the integrity and privacy of the process while increasing accessibility and trust in democratic participation.
